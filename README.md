# Timestamp Microservice

Given the user enters a ISO-8601 compliant date (e.g. "2016-11-20") in the URL, returned will be a JSON object with both Unix and UTC timestamps to view. Node and Express are used to implement a RESTful API for HTTP request handling. Within the route handler function, the given date is parsed into separate Unix and UTC formatted variables for return to the front-end.
